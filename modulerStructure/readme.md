Certainly! Let's consider an example where you have a package called "my_project" that contains multiple binary crates and one library crate.

The directory structure of your project could look like this:

```
my_project/
  ├── Cargo.toml
  ├── src/
  │   ├── main.rs         (Binary crate 1)
  │   ├── app.rs          (Binary crate 2)
  │   └── lib.rs          (Library crate)
```

In this example, `my_project` is the package root directory. The `src` directory contains the source code files for your project.

1. `main.rs`: This file represents the main entry point for the first binary crate. It contains the `main` function that will be executed when you run the corresponding executable.

2. `app.rs`: This file represents the main entry point for the second binary crate. Similar to `main.rs`, it contains a `main` function specific to this binary crate.

3. `lib.rs`: This file represents the library crate within the package. It contains reusable code, data structures, and functions that can be shared between the binary crates or other parts of the codebase.

The `Cargo.toml` file at the root of the package would contain the configuration and metadata for the entire package, including dependencies, version information, and other project-specific settings.

Here's a simplified example of a `Cargo.toml` file for this scenario:

```toml
[package]
name = "my_project"
version = "0.1.0"

[dependencies]
# Dependencies for the library crate
some_dependency = "1.0"

[[bin]]
name = "binary1"
path = "src/main.rs"

[[bin]]
name = "binary2"
path = "src/app.rs"
```

In this example, the `[[bin]]` section specifies the multiple binary crates within the package. Each `[[bin]]` entry includes the name of the binary crate and its corresponding source code file.

With this setup, you can build and run the individual binary crates separately using Cargo. For example, you can use `cargo run --bin binary1` to build and execute the first binary crate.

Remember that while you can have multiple binary crates within a package, there can be only one library crate. The library crate provides reusable code that can be shared among the binary crates or other parts of the project.
